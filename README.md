# CrapsSimulator
Classes that simulates a game of craps, helps you judge your betting strategy, optimize expected return/loss or minimize variance of your return/losses

## Why?
This is for a algorithms for non-linear optimization class, but it might be useful for general purposes for both degenerate or occaisional gamblers.

## What?
I will run some non linear optimization to optimize either:

1. Maximize Expected Profit/Loss
2. Minimize Variance of Profit/Loss

## How?
I will run some simulations to test the betting strategy outputted by the optimization and how well it does.

## Why should you care?
Disclaimer first, I am not guaranteeing any successful Craps betting strategy. 
I am taking a probabilistic approach and see what betting strategy has the best expected profit or has the least chance of losing money.
Please be careful! 

I'm not liable for you losing money.
